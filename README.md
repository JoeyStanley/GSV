# GSV
The Gazetteer of Southern Vowels

After a few years of these scripts running locally, it's time I switch the GSV to github. Unfortunately, I don't have all the previous versions available to me anymore, but hopefully from here on out it'll be easier to keep track of changes. 

Note that the formant data underlying the GSV is not publically available. Please contact the Linguistic Atlas Office to request permission to access the data.
